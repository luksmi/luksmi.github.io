Hi! My name is Łukasz and I'm a software engineer with ~4 years of experience. As a developer I grow mainly thanks to people that share their valuable knowledge over the Internet, that's why I made a decision to give back to the community and create this blog. Beside coding - a bass and piano player, Spanish educatee, snowboarder and Coca-Cola® lover.
