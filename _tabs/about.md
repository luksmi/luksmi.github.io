¡Hola, amigos! My name is Łukasz and I'm a software engineer since 2017. As a developer I grow mainly thanks to people that share their valuable knowledge over the Internet, that's why I made a decision to give back to the community and create this blog. Beside coding - bass/piano player, Spanish educatee, snowboarder and automotive freak.
