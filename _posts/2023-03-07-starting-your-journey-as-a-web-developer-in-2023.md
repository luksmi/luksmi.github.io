# Abstraction level: low vs. high 

Web development and low-level programming are two distinct paths in the world of programming. While both have their unique benefits, web development has emerged as the preferred choice for many programmers. In this article, we will explore some of the reasons why web development is a better choice in modern economy than low-level programming.

## Accessibility
One of the primary advantages of web development is its accessibility. Web development is based on high-level programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are relatively easy to learn and use. In contrast, low-level programming requires knowledge of lower-level languages such as C and Assembly, which can be difficult to learn for beginners.

## High deman
Another advantage of web development is its high demand. With the rise of e-commerce and digital marketing, businesses of all sizes require web developers to build and maintain their websites. This demand has led to a high number of job opportunities and a competitive salary for web developers.

## Flexibility
Web development is also flexible, as it allows developers to work from anywhere with an internet connection. This flexibility can be particularly advantageous for freelancers, who can work on their own terms and set their own hours.

## Rapid Development
Web development also enables developers to create applications and websites quickly. This is because web development frameworks and libraries exist to streamline the development process. In contrast, low-level programming requires more time and effort to write code, test it, and debug it.

## Growing industry
Finally, the web development industry is constantly growing and evolving, with new technologies and frameworks emerging regularly. This means that web developers have the opportunity to continually learn and grow their skills.

In conclusion, web development is better than low-level programming for many reasons. It is more accessible, has a higher demand, is flexible, allows for rapid development, and is constantly growing and evolving. If you're considering a career in programming, web development is a path worth exploring.

# Most popular web technologies

If you're a beginner looking to learn web programming, choosing the right language can be a daunting task. With so many programming languages available, it can be difficult to know which one to choose. In this article, we will explore five popular programming languages and help you determine which one may be best suited for your needs.

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a popular language for web development and is used for creating interactive web pages. It is a scripting language that can be run in any modern web browser. If you are interested in building web applications or working with front-end technologies such as HTML and CSS, JavaScript is an excellent language to start with.

## Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is popular for its simplicity and ease of use. It is used in a variety of applications, including data analysis, artificial intelligence, and web development. Python is a good choice for beginners because of its clear and concise syntax, which makes it easy to read and write.

## Go
Go is a relatively new programming language that was created by Google. It is designed to be simple, fast, and efficient, making it a good choice for systems programming and web development. While Go may not be the easiest language to learn for beginners, it is a great choice if you're interested in building high-performance applications.

## Java
Java is a popular programming language that is used for developing enterprise applications, mobile apps, and games. It is a compiled language, which means that the code is converted into machine-readable form before it is executed. Java is a good choice for beginners because of its extensive documentation and large community of developers.

## Kotlin
Kotlin is a modern, open-source programming language that is used for building Android apps. It is designed to be more concise and less error-prone than Java, which makes it easier to learn and use. If you are interested in developing Android applications, Kotlin is a great choice.

# Summary
Ultimately, the programming language you choose will depend on your interests and goals. If you're interested in web development, JavaScript or Python may be the best choice. If you're interested in building high-performance applications, Go may be the best choice. And if you're interested in developing Android applications, Kotlin or Java may be the best choice. Whatever language you choose, the most important thing is to start learning and practicing as soon as possible.
