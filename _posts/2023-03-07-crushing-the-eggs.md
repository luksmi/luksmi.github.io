## Prerequisites

Make sure you have classic old-school USB-A cable near you. You're gonna need it.

## Crashing

### Preparing the eggs

Put the eggs on the table. Depending on the number of the eggs, lay them down on a flat plate. 



And then execute:

```console
$ Hit each egg very hard with the USB-A socket, starting from 'left' to 'right' if you are left-handed, or the other way around if you are right-handed 
```
